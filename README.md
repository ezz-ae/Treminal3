# Terminal3: The AI-Native Web3 Development Platform

Welcome to Terminal3, the all-in-one, AI-powered platform designed to take you from idea to deployed dApp faster than ever before. Build, manage, and grow your entire Web3 presence using natural language and a suite of powerful, integrated tools.

## Core Features

- **AI Command Center**: The heart of Terminal3. A conversational, terminal-style interface where you can describe any task—from creating a new token to auditing a smart contract—and our advanced AI agents will execute it.
- **dApp Builder**: Describe your application, and let the AI generate a complete plan, including required UI components and smart contracts.
- **Token Launcher**: Generate secure, ERC-20 compliant smart contracts for your new cryptocurrency by simply describing its name, symbol, and supply.
- **Security Audits**: Paste in your Solidity code and receive a comprehensive security analysis, identifying potential vulnerabilities and providing recommendations.
- **DAO Governance Planning**: Design a complete governance structure for your Decentralized Autonomous Organization, including tokenomics, voting models, and operational plans.
- **On-chain Analytics**: A visually rich dashboard providing deep insights into on-chain data, from transaction volume to active wallets.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes a full suite of developer tools, staking options, and extensive documentation to support your entire journey.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Generative AI**: [Google's Gemini models](https://ai.google.dev/) via [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **Backend Services**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Authentication & Firestore)
- **UI**: [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Component Library**: [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Charts**: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. You will need to populate it with your Firebase project configuration and a Google AI API key.

#### Firebase Configuration

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project or select an existing one.
3.  Go to **Project settings** > **General**.
4.  Under "Your apps", click the web icon (`</>`) to create a new web app or use an existing one.
5.  Copy the `firebaseConfig` object values into your `.env` file as shown below.
6.  Enable **Google** as a Sign-in provider under **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**.
7.  Enable the **Firestore Database** service.

#### Google AI (Gemini) API Key

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Create a new API key.
3.  Copy the key into your `.env` file.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_project_id.firebaseapp.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_project_id.appspot.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_sender_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_app_id"

# Google AI (Genkit) API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key"
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## The Vision

Terminal3 is more than just a code editor; it's a new paradigm for Web3 development. By leveraging the power of generative AI, we remove the steep learning curves and boilerplate associated with blockchain development, allowing creators, founders, and developers to focus on what truly matters: building the future of the decentralized web.
