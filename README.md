# Terminal3: The AI-Native Web3 Development Platform

Welcome to Terminal3, the all-in-one, AI-powered platform designed to take you from idea to deployed dApp faster than ever before. Build, manage, and grow your entire Web3 presence using natural language and a suite of powerful, integrated tools.

## Core Features

- **AI Command Center**: The heart of Terminal3. A conversational, terminal-style interface where you can describe any task—from creating a new token to auditing a smart contract—and our advanced AI agents will execute it.
- **dApp Builder**: Describe your application, and let the AI generate a complete plan, including required UI components and smart contracts.
- **Token Launcher**: Generate secure, ERC-20 compliant smart contracts for your new cryptocurrency by simply describing its name, symbol, and supply.
- **Security Audits**: Paste in your Solidity code and receive a comprehensive security analysis, identifying potential vulnerabilities and providing recommendations.
- **DAO Governance Planning**: Design a complete governance structure for your Decentralized Autonomous Organization, including tokenomics, voting models, and operational plans.
- **On-chain Analytics**: A visually rich dashboard providing deep insights into on-chain data, from transaction volume to active wallets.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes a full suite of developer tools, staking options, and extensive documentation to support your entire journey.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](httpss://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Generative AI**: [Google's Gemini models](httpss://ai.google.dev/) via [Genkit](httpss://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **UI**: [React](httpss://react.dev/), [TypeScript](httpss://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](httpss://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Component Library**: [ShadCN UI](httpss://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Charts**: [Recharts](httpss://recharts.org/)

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## The Vision

Terminal3 is more than just a code editor; it's a new paradigm for Web3 development. By leveraging the power of generative AI, we remove the steep learning curves and boilerplate associated with blockchain development, allowing creators, founders, and developers to focus on what truly matters: building the future of the decentralized web.
