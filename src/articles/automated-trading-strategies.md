Unleash the power of automation with our Trading Bot Platform. This article explores how you can leverage pre-built templates for strategies like arbitrage and market-making, or describe your own custom logic in a secure sandboxed environment. We'll cover how to connect to exchange APIs via our AI agents, use our powerful backtesting engine with historical data, and deploy your bot for live trading. You can prompt the system with "Develop a bot that buys token X on Uniswap and sells it on Sushiswap if the price difference is greater than 2%." Stop watching the charts and let your agent do the work.
