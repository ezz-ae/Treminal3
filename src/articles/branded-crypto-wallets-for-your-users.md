Why send your users to a third-party wallet? With our Custom Wallet builder, you can create a secure, branded wallet experience directly within your application. This note covers how you can prompt our AI to "Design a wallet for my dApp with our logo, a blue color scheme, and pre-configured for the Polygon network." We'll also discuss the underlying security features that are included by default, including multi-sig support and hardware wallet integration, ensuring your users' assets are always safe.
