AI Agents are the next frontier of Web3 automation. This guide explains how to create agents that can be triggered by specific on-chain events, such as a large token transfer or a change in a smart contract's state. We'll show you how to give your agent a goal, like "rebalance my DeFi portfolio when asset A's value exceeds 50% of the total," and let it determine the best course of action by calling different contracts and services. This is true automation for the decentralized world, all powered by natural language commands.
