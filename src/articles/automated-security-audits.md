Don't deploy with bugs. Our automated Security Audits tool is your first line of defense against potential exploits. This guide explains how to simply paste your Solidity code into the AI Command Center and ask for an audit. The AI will analyze the code for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows, front-running risks, and improper access control. While not a substitute for a full manual audit, this tool can catch common mistakes and give you a detailed report on your contract's security posture in minutes, helping you build with confidence.
