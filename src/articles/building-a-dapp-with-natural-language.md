Building a dApp is now as easy as describing it. With Terminal3's "Full Automatic" mode, you can simply write a prompt like "Create an NFT marketplace for digital artists with a 5% royalty fee." Our AI will interpret your request, select the appropriate smart contract templates, generate the front-end components, and present you with a functional baseline. It analyzes your needs, proposes a full architecture including required smart contracts and UI components, and then generates the code. This article walks you through the process, from crafting the perfect prompt to making minor tweaks to the AI-generated output. It's the fastest way to go from idea to MVP.
