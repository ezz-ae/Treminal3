Running a DAO is more than just deploying a contract. Our DAO Governance tools help you manage the entire lifecycle. This article covers how to use the AI to generate a full governance plan. You can use a prompt like "Design a DAO for a gaming guild that uses token-weighted voting for major decisions and a council for minor ones." The AI will generate a plan including the tokenomics, voting structure, and operational steps. You can then use our tools to create proposals, manage voting, and execute passed proposals on-chain, all through a transparent and easy-to-use governance dashboard.
