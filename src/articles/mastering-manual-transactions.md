Sometimes, you need to get your hands dirty. The Manual Transactions tool gives you a direct interface to any EVM-compatible blockchain. This advanced guide shows you how to construct and broadcast raw transactions, call specific functions on any smart contract by providing its ABI, and decode transaction data for deep analysis. You can also use the AI agent with prompts like "Call the 'mint' function on contract 0x... with the parameter '5'." It's the ultimate tool for developers and researchers who need precise control over their on-chain interactions.
