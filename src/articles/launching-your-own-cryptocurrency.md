Ever dreamed of launching your own token? The Token Launcher makes it a reality. This guide covers how our AI can parse a simple description like "Create a deflationary utility token called 'Galaxy Dust' with the symbol GLX and a total supply of 1 billion" to generate a secure, ERC-20 compliant smart contract.
